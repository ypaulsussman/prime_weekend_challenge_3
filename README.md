# To-Do App! #

For this weekend's challenge, you are going to create a 'TO DO' application.

### Specific components: ###

[x] Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a task.

[X] When the task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)

[X] Whenever a task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.

[X] Each task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.

[x] When a task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. _(For example, the background of the task container could change, and/or the complete option could be 'checked off.' Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete.)_

[X] Whether or not a task is complete should also be stored in the database.

[X] Deleting a task should remove it both from the Front End as well as the Database.

[X] Make sure that you also show us your best styling chops.

Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code.

Include a .sql file with CREATE TABLE statements or you can create your schema automatically when your app loads.

### HARD MODE (Stretch Goal 1) ###

[x] In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task.
Once again, you can interrupt this however you would like.

### PRO MODE (Stretch Goal 2) ###

[x] Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page, where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.
